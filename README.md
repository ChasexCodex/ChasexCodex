 - Hi, My name is Elyas Al-Amri, but I go with the alias Chase Codex. I started programming back when I was 15.
 - I’m interested in software programming in the fields of game development, web development, and mobile development. I'm also a mediocre music producer and I 
       play a little piano.
 - <strong>Programming Languages</strong>: <br>Primary: Java, C#, Javascript, PHP, Front-end stack (HTML, CSS, JS) + TS, F#, SQL.
                          <br>Secondary (can work with but don't use often): VB, Python, Dart, and Kotline.
                          <br>Thirdly (haven't used it for a very long time and forgot the syntax, still can manage my way if required): Lua, Ruby, Go.
 - I’m currently learning GUI frameworks: WPF, Xamarin, MAUI (When .Net 6 gets released), Expo (React Native), VueJS, and Programming languages: C++ and Dart.
 - I'm looking forward to joining a team for any project
